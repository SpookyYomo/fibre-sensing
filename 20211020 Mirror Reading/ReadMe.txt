Due to limited space in the thumbdrive, these files no longer reside in the thumbdrive, and only the copies exist primarily here in this dropbox.
They represent different frequency of oscillations of mirrors with different peak-to-peak voltages.

Batch 1 - 80.1250MHz
Batch 2 - 80.250MHz (data is useless; has been deleted)
Batch 3 - 80.250MHz (data is useless; has been deleted)
Batch 4 - 80.125049MHz (account for deviation of oscilliscope). Here, we can see that the correction term of .000049 gives to a rough gradient of -60 rad/s, in contrast to the -10^4 rad/s without the correction term.
Batch 5 - 80.125030 to 80.125080. The goal is to attempt to determine the appropriate correction term.
Roughly identified the best setting to be around 80.125055MHz. further zooming in to be done on Batch 6.
Batch 6 - Confirms that on a different day, the "ideal" frequency offset is actually even worse.
Batch 7a - A failed attempt at using a reference frequency.
