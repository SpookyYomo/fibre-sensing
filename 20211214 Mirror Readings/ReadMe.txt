This batch of files aims to test the sensitivity (low mVpp) and linearity (high mVpp) of the setup.

This set of results is done with the 40GS/s borrowed oscilliscope.

Batch 0: A test of having external reference clock. Confirmed that the external reference indeed has minimal drift.

Batch 1: Data was stopped collecting after investigating for 4 and 5Hz of oscillating Mirror at low driven amplitudes. Moved onto resolving 2pi jumps after this.
