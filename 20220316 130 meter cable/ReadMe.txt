These data were originally collected in an attempt to see the "cauchy distribution" variance as a function of sampling freqeucny

It was later observed that the N=4 data has a random walk in it.

batch 1: N = 4 taken on 16 Mar - random walk observed
batch 2: N = 8 taken on 16 Mar - same noise profile as batch 1, drift was excessive

covid, physical set up reduced to a different setup.
figures from here are taken specifically for thesis
batch 3: N = 8 taken on 28 Mar - drift was very excessive
batch 4: taken on 28 mar
- A,B: N= 8, failure
- C: N= 8, -1.0Mhz-00000.trc was good, radius however was fluctating alot with the new physical setup.
- D: N= 4, trying to replicate for random walk. unsuccesful
- E: N= 4, using lower laser current, seeing if it works to have a random walk.
- F: N= 8, using lower laser current, seeing if it has minimal drift.
