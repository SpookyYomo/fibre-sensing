# FYP - PC4199 (AY21/22) Fibre Sensing Project

Project description of Michaelson interferometers, addition of AOM, demodulation. Issues occur due to moving from hardware to software, particularly with time discretization.

Repo contains libraries and working files necessary in demodulating and studying traces of signals detected from InGaAs photodiode.
