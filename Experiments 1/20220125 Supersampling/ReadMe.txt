This document will recording a trace at a fixed recording that >f_sampling necessary for I/Q demodulation, to be able to determine when 2pi jumps occur. Traces are recorded at various AOM frequencies and mirror oscillations, particularly also at those where alot of 2pi jumps were observed to have occured for 24 Jan's "linear with frequency" oscillations. 

The express purpose of this folder is to identify source of error by no longer subsampling.


Batch 1: 25 Jan 9.30pm
80.125 MHz AOM, mirror freq at 0, 40, 134, 1000, 1050 Hz.
Sampling freq is at 100MS/s => 100 times the usual 1MS/s.git
